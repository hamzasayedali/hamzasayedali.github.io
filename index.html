        <h1>Hi, I'm Hamza</h1>
        <p>There's this Mary Oliver poem that I like, it goes:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "As long as you're dancing, you can. Break the rules. <br/> 
            Sometimes breaking the rules is just. <br/>Extending the rules. <br/><br/>
            Sometimes there are no rules"
        </blockquote>
        <p>Enjoy your stay here!</p>
