    <h2>How to Wrap Up a Coding Project</h2>
    <h3>Dec 11th 2023 - Waterloo, ON</h3>
    <p>One of the things I struggle with the most as an engineer is wrapping up projects once I've completed most of the functionality.
        I think this has to do with most of my school projects pushing me more to pass whatever minimal test cases are provided and BOOM go
        study for your next thing. This serves fine for passing classes but misses important lessons in engineering. How do I make
        my own test cases? How do I make something usable for anyone in the real world? How do I know when I'm finished? All great questions.
        I was wrestling with these at work and after a convo with a senior engineer at my job we came up with this checklist/guide that lives on this page now.

    <h2>How to Direct a Dance Team</h2>
    <h3>Sept 20 2022 - Waterloo, ON</h3>
    <p>At Waterloo, UW Hip Hop club is one of the most exciting communities I've joined. It's a dance club
        that has drop in sessions twice a week where students prepare teach choreographies. But in addition to those
        drop-in sessions, you have the option to join a performance team where you work on and hone the same 
        choreography for the whole term as part of a large group. This is the part that I found the most exciting and now,
        one year after joining the club, I applied to lead one of these teams.
