    <h2>How to Wrap Up a Coding Project</h2>
    <h3>Dec 11th 2023 - Waterloo, ON</h3>
    <p>One of the things I struggle with the most as an engineer is wrapping up projects once I've completed most of the functionality.
        I think this has to do with most of my school projects pushing me more to pass whatever minimal test cases are provided and BOOM go
        study for your next thing. This serves fine for passing classes but misses important lessons in engineering. How do I make
        my own test cases? How do I make something usable for anyone in the real world? How do I know when I'm finished? All great questions.
        I was wrestling with these at work and after a convo with a senior engineer at my job we came up with this checklist/guide that lives on this page now.

        <ol>
        <li>Have Library code correct</li> 
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li style="margin-left:2em">a. Make a list of all the functionality that needs to get done. Either from a spec sheet, gathering requirements from the person who’s gonna use it, your boss, the library you are trying to control, the functional requirements sheet. IDK.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">b. Write all the code you need to do these things (this is the fun easy to internalize part. Your brain knows what something looks like when it works.)
            </li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">c. Once you have all the functions that you need with all the inputs and outputs, you’re goldeN good job. </li>
        </ol>
            
                     <li>Code-level Cleaning fixes:</li>
            a. Make sure it passes linter
            b. Flake8 & MyPy (what is a Flake8, what is a mypy?)
        <li>Documentation:</li>
            a. docs build thru Sphinx
            b. Assume default is anything implemented works
            c. Raise warning: Untested: print from function & in docs
            d. Mark clearly for what needs to be picked up

        </ol>

    <h2>How to Direct a Dance Team</h2>
    <h3>Sept 20 2022 - Waterloo, ON</h3>
    <p>At Waterloo, UW Hip Hop club is one of the most exciting communities I've joined. It's a dance club
        that has drop in sessions twice a week where students prepare teach choreographies. But in addition to those
        drop-in sessions, you have the option to join a performance team where you work on and hone the same 
        choreography for the whole term as part of a large group. This is the part that I found the most exciting and now,
        one year after joining the club, I applied to lead one of these teams.
