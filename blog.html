    <h2>How to Direct a Dance Team</h2>
    <h3>Sept 20 2022 - Waterloo, ON</h3>
    <p>At Waterloo, UW Hip Hop club is one of the most exciting communities I've joined. It's a dance club
        that has drop in sessions twice a week where students prepare teach choreographies. But in addition to those
        drop-in sessions, you have the option to join a performance team where you work on and hone the same 
        choreography for the whole term as part of a large group. This is the part that I found the most exciting and now,
        one year after joining the club, I applied to lead one of these teams.
